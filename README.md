My app aims to help keep track of what they eat as well as provide healthy and cheap breakfast, lunch, and dinner suggestions. There are also organizations that help solve world hunger that the user can donate to. Finally, there is a carb, calories, and protein calculator so that the user keeps track of how much of each they've consumed in a day. 

How my app works: 

1. The first thing you have to do in my app is sign up. 
2. After this you should login and in case you forgot your password, you can click on 'forgot password' and it will redirect you to a page where you can input your gmail so that firebase sends you an email to change your password. 
3. After you login, you are directed to the home page where the first card you see is breakfast
4. Once you click on the carb 'breakfast', there will be recipe suggestions where you can click the down arrow of each card to read the ingredients, steps, and nutritional value. There is also a filter for recipes that have a price of 20, 15, 10, and 5 dollars. 
5. There is also a lunch card which is exactly like the breakfast card but with lunch recipes. 
6. There is also a dinner card which is exactly like the breakfast card but with dinner recipes. 
7. There are 4 organizations in the home page that the user can click on to donate money 
8. There are also 3 calculator options in the home page: carb calculator, protein calculator, and calorie calculator.
9. In the carb calculator you input the max amount of carbs that you want to eat per day. You then add an input every time you eat a new food and place the carb value of that food. Everytime you add an input, the amount will be added and shown. If the amount of carbs you eat in a day exceeds the max amount of carbs that you put in the input, a message will appear warning you that you have exceeded the amount of carbs in a day. There is a date picker so that you can input this information daily. 
10. The calories calculator is the same as the carb calculator but you will input how much calories you eat in a day
11. The protein calories are also similar to the previous calculators but instead of adding the max amount of proteins you want to eat in a day, you add the minimum amount of proteins to eat in a day. 
12. Then, you have the Settings, where you can change your email and password
13. Finally, you have the index, where you can see the glycemic index of a variety of foods.
